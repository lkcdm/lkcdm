## Hi there, I'm kcldm（小柯）. 👋
It's a pleasure to have friends coming from afar.

Nice to meet you, I am a student who is still learning, and my dream is to meet someone worth giving my heart to!

As my blog describes: Love is not about finding the perfect person, but about seeing an imperfect person perfectly.

My virtual image is not very perfect, and I don't have much artistic talent, so I'm very happy that someone will help me design it, though it sounds like bad behavior.<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983c5f5e-aa79-40b6-aa03-9a4edc59b548" alt="img" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- 🤔 I most want to create a little world of my own.
- ❤️ I like kittens, cats can make me very happy.
- 💬 If you need any help, feel free to email me!
